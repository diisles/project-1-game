- Player can click on the cards on the board.
- The cards tapped will then flip around to show the face on the other side.
- IF the two cards match faces then they will get credit for the matched faces and the cards will remain turned over.
- If the cards chosen don't match they will flip back around for further play.
- When all cards have been matched correctly they will get a "You Win" signal with the time it took them and amount of turns played in that round.
